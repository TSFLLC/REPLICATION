This error usually comes when particular record does not exists on subscriber and a update or delete command executed for same record on primary server 
and which got replicated on subscriber as well.As this records does not exists on subscriber, replication throws an error " Row Not Found"
Solution of this error to make replication work back to the normal running state:

We can check with following query, whether request at publisher was of update or delete statement


  1-
USE [distribution]

SELECT *
FROM   msrepl_commands 
WHERE  publisher_database_id = 1
       AND command_id = 1
       AND xact_seqno = 0x00099979000038D6000100000000
   
   2-    
 We can get artical id information from above query, which can be passed to below proc:      
       EXEC Sp_browsereplcmds
  @article_id = 813,
  @command_id = 1,
  @xact_seqno_start = '0x00099979000038D60001',
  @xact_seqno_end = '0x00099979000038D60001',
  @publisher_database_id = 1
  
  Above query will give information about, whether it was a update statement or delete statement.

In Case of Delete Statement
That record can be directly deleted from msrepl_commands objects so that replication won't make retry attempts for the record.
     
     3. statement to delete records in msrepl_comment
     DELETE FROM msrepl_commands
WHERE  publisher_database_id = 1
       AND command_id =1
       AND xact_seqno = 0x00099979000038D6000100000000 
       
       4- 
       In case of update statement:
You need to insert that record manually from publisher DB to subscriber DB:
